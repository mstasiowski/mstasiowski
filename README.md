## 👋 Hi, I'm Michał!

I'm an aspiring **Full-Stack Developer**, freshly after completing my master's degree and currently looking for my first commercial experience. I build **SPA web applications**, mainly using **.NET (C#)** on the backend and **Angular** on the frontend.

I enjoy creating projects from scratch. From the initial idea, through the design phase, to a working application that solves real problems.

🎓 **Education**  
- Engineering studies in Applied Computer Science (specialization: Web Application Development), WSEI Kraków  
- Master's studies in Applied Computer Science (specialization: Cybersecurity), WSEI Kraków

🛠️ On my profile, you'll find projects I've built while learning, experimenting, and developing my skills as a developer.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out! 🚀
